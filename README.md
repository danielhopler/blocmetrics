# Blocmetrics

An analytics app that users can use with their apps to track user activity.
* Key features:

* Ruby 2.6.0
* [Chartkick](https://github.com/ankane/chartkick#installation) - gem for creating JavaScript charts

	   var event = {event: { name: eventName }};

	   // #2
	   var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
	   // #3
	   request.open("POST", "http://localhost:3000/api/events", true);
	   // #4
